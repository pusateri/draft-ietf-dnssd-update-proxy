                    draft-ietf-dnssd-update-proxy-00

Abstract

   This document describes a method to dynamically map multicast DNS
   advertisements into the unicast DNS namespace for use by service
   discovery clients.  It does not define any new protocols but uses
   existing DNS protocols in new ways.  This solves existing problems
   with service discovery across multiple IP subnets in a simple, yet
   efficient, manner.

1.  Introduction

   Multicast DNS is used today for link-local service discovery.  While
   this has worked reasonably well on the local link, current deployment
   reveals two problems.  First, mDNS wasn't designed to traverse across
   multi-subnet campus networks.  Second, IP multicast doesn't work
   across all link types and can be problematic on 802.11 Wifi networks.
   Therefore, a solution is desired to contain legacy multicast DNS
   service discovery and transition to a unicast DNS service discovery
   model.  By mapping the current mDNS discovered services into regular
   unicast DNS authoritative servers, clients from any IP subnet can
   make unicast queries through normal unicast DNS resolvers.

Internet-Draft          DNS Update Proxy for mDNS          February 2019


   There are many ways to map services discovered using multicast DNS
   into the unicast namespace.  This document describes a way to do the
   mapping using a proxy that sends DNS Update messages directly to a
   unicast DNS authoritative server.  While it is possible for each
   service advertiser to send it's own DNS Update, key management has
   prevented widespread deployment of DNS Updates across a domain.  By
   having a limited number of proxies sitting on one or more IP subnets,
   it is possible to provide secure DNS updates at a manageable scale.
   Future work to automate secure DNS Updates on a larger scale is
   needed.

   This document will explain how services on each .local domain will be
   mapped into the unicast DNS namespace and how unicast clients will
   discover these services.  It is important to note that no changes are
   required in either the clients, DNS authoritative servers, or DNS
   resolver infrastructure.  In addition, while the Update Proxy is a
   new logical concept, it requires no new protocols to be defined and
   can be built using existing DNS libraries.

2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.  These words may also appear in this
   document in lower case as plain English words, absent their normative
   meanings.

3.  DNS subdomain model

   Each .local domain which logically maps to an IP subnet is modeled as
   a separate subdomain in the unicast DNS hierarchy.  Each of these
   subdomains must be browseable (respond to PTR queries for b._dns-
   sd._udp.<subdomain>.<domain>.).  See Section 11 of [RFC6763] for more
   details about browsing.  These subdomains are typically special use
   subdomains for mDNS mappings.

3.1.  Subdomain naming

   The browseable subdomain label is prepended to the domain name and
   seperated by a period.  See [RFC7719] for more information on
   subdomains and labels.  It is not important that the label be human
   readable or have organizational significance.  End users will not be
   interacting with these labels.  The main requirement is that they be
   unique within the domain for each IP subnet.  Subdomain labels can be
   obtained by the proxy in several ways.  The following methods should
   be attempted in order to assure consistency amoung redundant proxies:

   1.  PTR query for IP subnet through local resolver

       As an example, suppose a proxy was connected to IPv4 subnet
       203.0.113.0/24.  In order to determine if there was a subdomain
       name for this subnet, the proxy would issue a PTR query for
       0.113.0.203.in-addr.arpa.  If a response is returned with an
       answer, then the name in the answer should be the subdomain name
       including the domain name for the network.

   2.  proxy local configuration override

       If no answer is returned, the proxy may have local configuration
       containing a subdomain name for the network.  If so, this
       subdomain should be used.

   3.  algorithmic subdomain label generation

       If no local configuration is present for the IP subnet, the proxy
       may generate a unique label and use that for the subdomain by
       appending a common domain name.  One such algorithm is to take
       the network form of an IPv4 subnet without a prefix length (host
       portion all zeros) and convert it to hexidecimal.  This will give
       a 8 character unique string to use as a subdomain label.

3.2.  Domain name discovery

   The base domain name to use for each subdomain also has to be
   discovered on a per IP subnet basis.  In most cases, the domain name
   will be the same for all IP subnets because they are all contained in
   a single administrative domain.  However, this is not required and a
   proxy administrator may need to span multiple administrative
   boundaries requiring different domain names on different IP subnets
   (and therefore, subdomains).

   There is not a direct query to discover a separate domain name but
   the domain name is included with the subdomain in the response to the
   PTR query above in Section 3.1.  If the PTR query returns an empty
   response, then the domain name can be obtained from local proxy
   configuration and if no domain name is specified there, the default
   domain for the host should be used.

3.3.  Client service discovery

   Fortunately, clients performing service discovery require no changes
   in order to work with the Update proxy.  Existing clients already
   support wide-area bonjour which specifies how to query search domains
   and subdomains for services.  See section 11 of [RFC6763].

4.  Update proxy behavior

   Since no new protocols are defined, this document mostly describes
   the expected behavior of the Update proxy and how it uses existing
   protocols to achieve multi IP subnet service discovery.  The behavior
   is mostly intuitive but is described to ensure compatibility and
   completeness.

4.1.  mDNS service announcements

   The Update proxy should listen to mDNS service announcements
   (responses) on all interfaces it is proxying for.  Multiple Update
   proxies can be active on the same IP subnet at the same time.  See
   [RFC6762] for more information on multicast DNS.

4.2.  Service caching and refresh

   As specified in Section 8.3 of [RFC6762] service announcements are
   sent multiple times for redundancy.  However, there is no need to
   send duplicate Update messages to the authoritative unicast DNS
   server.  Therefore, the Update proxy should cache service
   announcements and only send DNS Update messages when needed.

   As described in Section 8.4 of [RFC6762], a host may send "goodbye"
   announcements by setting the TTL to 0.  In this case, the record MUST
   be removed from the cache or otherwise marked as expired and a DNS
   Update should be sent to the authoritative unicast DNS server
   removing the record.

   The Update proxy MUST also remove/expire old cache entries and remove
   the records from the unicast authoritative DNS server when the cache-
   flush bit is set on new announcements as described in Section 10.2 of
   [RFC6762].

4.3.  mDNS probing

   While [RFC6762] recommends all potential answers be included in mDNS
   probe queries, because these records haven't gone through conflict
   resolution, they should not be regarded as announcements of services.
   Therefore, an Update proxy MUST NOT rely on information in any
   section of DNS query messages.

4.4.  Link-local addressing

   In the IPv6 case, the source address of the announcements is a link-
   local IPv6 address that will probably be different than the IP subnet
   that the service is being provided on.  However, it is certainly
   possible that link-local addressing is used with IPv4 as well.  This

   is not as common but exists in a zero-conf environment where no IPv4
   addresses are assigned via DHCP or statically and the hosts revert to
   link-local IPv4 addresses (169.254/16), see [RFC3927].

   If the service SRV target resolves to only a link-local address, then
   the service is not eligble to be advertised outside of the link and
   shouldn't be sent to the authoritative unicast DNS server by the
   Update proxy.

   In general, the Update proxy needs to ensure that the service is
   reachable outside of the link it is announced on before sending an
   Update to the authoritative server for the subdomain.

4.5.  IPv6 and IPv4 on same link

   Announced services may be available on IPv4, IPv6, or both on the
   same link.  If both IPv4 'A' records [RFC1035] and IPv6 'AAAA'
   records [RFC3596] are published for an SRV target [RFC2782] name, the
   administrator should provide the service over both protocols.

   In some cases, this won't be possible.  This will not incur any extra
   delays if clients attempt connections over both IPv4 and IPv6
   protocols simultaneously but if one protocol is preferred over
   another, delays may occur.

4.6.  multiple logical IP subnets

   Multiple IP subnets on the same link are just a more general case of
   IPv4 and IPv6 on the same link.  When multiple IP subnets exist for
   the same protocol on the same link, they appear as separate
   interfaces to the Update proxy and require a separate subdomain name
   just as IPv4 and IPv6 do.

   This is required for a client on one logical IP subnet of an
   interface to communicate with a service provided by a host on a
   different IP subnet of the same link.

   If a SRV target resolves to addresses on multiple logical IP subnets
   of the same interface, the service can be included in multiple
   subdomains on the appropriate server(s) for those subdomains.

4.7.  Proxy redundancy

7.  Comparison to Discovery Proxy

   The Update Proxy defined in this document is an alternative to the
   Discovery Proxy [I-D.ietf-dnssd-hybrid] and the Discovery Relay
   [I-D.ietf-dnssd-mdns-relay].  This solution makes different trade-
   offs than the ones made by the Discovery Proxy which offer
   substantial advantages at a cost of increased state.

   These advantages include limiting further propagation of IP multicast
   across the campus, providing a pathway to eliminate multicast
   entirely, faster response time to client queries, and the ability to
   provide DNSSEC signed security responses for client queries.
